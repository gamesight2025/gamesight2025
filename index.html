            Soccer commentary plays a crucial role in enhancing the soccer game viewing experience for audiences. The automatic soccer commentary generation task, however, presents a challenge to the comprehensive narrative that integrates both coarse-grained event detection and fine-grained factual detail references. Previous studies typically adopt an end-to-end method that generates anonymous, context-free, and descriptive commentaries to explicate the game events. Such generated commentaries are clearly unnatural, as they lack the fine-grained visual and contextual information that human commentators possess for further insights. <strong>To bridge the gap, we propose GameSight, a two-stage model to address soccer commentary generation as a knowledge-enhanced visual reasoning task, enabling knowledgeable commentary with accurate reference to entities (players and teams).</strong>  GameSight starts by performing visual reasoning to align anonymous entities with contextual background and fine-grained view shots analysis. Subsequently, the entity-aligned commentary is refined with knowledge by incorporating external historical statistics and iteratively updated internal game state information. Consequently, <strong> GameSight improves the player alignment accuracy by 26.8% on SN-Caption-test-align dataset compared to Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite.</strong> Combined with further knowledge enhancement,<strong> GameSight outperforms in both local scale (segment-level) statistical accuracy and global scale (game-level) contextual relevance and structural composition.</strong> We believe that our work paves the way for a more informative and engaging human-centric experience with the AI sports application.          </p>

                <br>The commentary event is described as occurring around 16:17 to 16:29 seconds in the video. The event involves a player from Barcelona taking a shot that goes wide of the goalpost. This suggests we need to focus on the Barcelona team's actions during this time frame.
                <br><br>Step 2: Analyze the Attack and Defense Sides
                <br>Given that the shot was taken by a Barcelona player, we need to identify who among their players fits the description of taking a shot. <span style="color: green;">The Barcelona team has several attackers, including Lionel Messi (jersey number 10), Neymar (jersey number 11), and Luis Suarez (jersey number 9)✔️</span>. Since the shot was taken from around 24 meters out, it is likely an attacking midfielder or forward who has possession and takes the shot.
                <br><br>Step 3: Identify the Player Involved
                <br><span style="color: green;">In the video, we see a player in a blue and red jersey (Barcelona) dribbling the ball towards the goal. This player is Neymar, as indicated by the close-up view showing his face and jersey number 11. The player's movement and positioning align with the description of taking a shot from a distance.✔️</span>
                <br><br>Step 4: Context Knowledge Analysis
                <br>From the history_timeline, we know that Lionel Messi was involved in an offside situation earlier. However, there is no direct evidence linking him to the shot described in the commentary.<span style="color: green;"> The close-up view of Neymar confirms his involvement in the event, as he is the only player from Barcelona seen in the close-up view during the relevant time frame.✔️</span>
                <br><br>Final Deduction

                <br>The commentary event is described as occurring around 15-17 seconds in the video. This is where the shot attempt is mentioned, and we need to focus on the scene around this time.
                <br><br>Step 2: Analyze the Attack and Defense Sides
                <br>The commentary mentions a "shot attempt" by a player from the home team, Paris SG. Given that Paris SG is playing against Arsenal, <span style="color: green;">the attacking side would be Paris SG, and the defending side would be Arsenal. Therefore, the player who attempts the shot is more likely to be from Paris SG.✔️</span>
                <br><br>Step 3: Identify the Player Involved
                <br><span style="color: green;">In the video, around 15-17 seconds, there is a player in a blue jersey (Paris SG) who appears to be involved in an attacking play. This player is seen running towards the goal area with the ball. His jersey number is visible as 22, and his name is Jese</span>,✔️ which matches the information given in the history_timeline.
                <br><br>Step 4: Context Knowledge Analysis
                <br><span style="color: green;">From the history_timeline, we know that Jese has been substituted into the game. This suggests he is actively participating in the match and is likely to be involved in significant plays, such as attempting shots on goal.✔️</span>
                <br><br>Conclusion 
                <br>Based on the analysis, the player who conducted the shot attempt is Jese from Paris SG. His jersey number is 22, and his name is clearly identifiable in the video.

                <br><br>Step 4: Context Knowledge Analysis
                <br>The history_timeline indicates that a player from Real Madrid picked up a long through ball, but another player from the same team intercepted it. This suggests that players from Real Madrid were actively involved in the play leading up to the event. The close-up view of Pepe further supports his involvement in the event.

                <br><span style="color: green;">Given that the event involves a defender blocking a pass, it's logical to look at the attacking side (Dortmund) and the defending side (Bayer Leverkusen). Since the defender is from Bayer Leverkusen, we need to identify who among their players fits the description of making a pass.✔️</span>

          <td>In the 52nd minute of the match, Edinson Cavani times his run too early, and the linesman raises his flag for offside. It’s a frustrating moment for the Paris SG forward, who has already found the net twice in this UEFA Champions League season. The away team will be hoping to capitalize on their attacking efforts as they trail 2-1 against Arsenal here at the Emirates Stadium.</td>

          <td>Lucas (Paris SG) takes a mid-range free kick and his stunning strike crashes against the crossbar.</td>
          <td>Lucas Moura steps up for a mid-range free kick, showcasing his trademark technique! He strikes it brilliantly, but it crashes against the crossbar, sending shockwaves through the Emirates Stadium. Paris SG is putting the pressure on Arsenal, as Lucas looks to add to his three goals this season. The score remains 1-1 here in the second half!</td>

          <td>Willian (Chelsea) takes the resulting corner which is well defended. Chelsea will take a corner kick.</td>
          <td>Willian steps up to take the corner for Chelsea after a well-defended sequence. They’ve been pressing hard, looking to extend their lead. The current score stands at 2-1 in favor of the visitors. The last corner was also for Chelsea, but they’ll look to make this one count at Carrow Road. Let’s see how Norwich’s defense responds!</td>

          <td>Grzegorz Krychowiak brings down an opponent, and referee Svein Moen swiftly halts play. It’s a strategic foul from the Sevilla midfielder as they look to regain control of the game. We’re now at 33 minutes and 38 seconds into the second half, with Sevilla trailing 1-3 against Manchester City. Krychowiak, who has already received a yellow card earlier, will need to be cautious for the remainder of the match.</td>

The Brazilian midfielder clearly disagrees with the decision as he gestures his frustration. Meanwhile, Southampton has already received two yellow cards in this match, with Ryan Bertrand and Sadio Mane already cautioned. The tension is palpable as Chelsea leads 1-0 following Willian’s early free-kick goal.</td>

          <td>As we approach the midway point of the second half, Franck Ribery has just received a yellow card for Bayern Munich after a late challenge. This adds to the growing tension in this highly contested match at Signal Iduna Park, with Dortmund leading 1-0 following Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s opening goal in the first half. Ribery’s booking could have significant implications as both teams battle for control. This marks the third yellow card of the match, with Adrian Ramos and Marc Bartra already cautioned for Dortmund. The stakes are high as we inch closer to the final whistle.</td>

          <td>Juanmi has found the back of the net for Malaga! At the 70th minute, a perfectly timed cross allows him to break free one-on-one with Iker Casillas. The young forward rises above the defenders to deliver a brilliant header down into the center of the goal, leaving the Real Madrid keeper with no chance. This goal comes as Malaga seeks to fight back after being two goals down. The score now stands at 2-1, and the home crowd at the Santiago Bernabéu is stunned!</td>

Referee Manuel Grafe didn’t hesitate to brandish the card, a clear indication of the game’s growing physicality.
